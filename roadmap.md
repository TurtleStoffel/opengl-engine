# Roadmap

## Minimal Viable Product (WIP)
Minimal requirements that would lead to a game that would be 'interesting' to play.

* Player is able to move around and 'look at' objects (no discussion about interaction), there are
4 levels the player should be able to observe
** Planet
** System
** Galaxy

* Player needs some sort of items that are used to 'interact' with the world (what those items are
and how the interaction would work is not defined yet) There would be two types of items:
** To interact with the world
** To interact with 'civilizations'
Having those items also implies there is a way to obtain them

* Simplified planetary motion. This can potentially be very complex, but only the amount is needed
that would actually lead to interesting gameplay. (no N-Body Simulation, but simplified 'realistic'
orbital mechanics.

* Civilizations = 'inhabitants of planets', which can be controlled (indirectly) by the player.

* Galaxy Generation/Simulation.
How realistic/far to go with this?

* Player interactions with civilizations


## Phase II
* Intergalactic Scene
